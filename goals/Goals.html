	David's current life goal is to become an adult.  Something as obscure as becoming an adult leaves a lot of room for decisions and its a broad topic. It will happen in due time so it's not impossible to reach but it's a goal he has. 

	Some micro-goals he hopes to accomplish is to have a good Freshman year. Half of the year is over, and it is going as well as well can be but there are is still a while to go.
