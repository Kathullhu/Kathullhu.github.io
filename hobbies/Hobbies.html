<h2>Dexterity</h2>
<div id = "Dexterity">
<p>Many of the activites David partakes in require usage of his hands. He likes to play games and type. Typing has been an outlet for David as he enjoys the clicking sound of the keyboard and the satisfaction provided from seeing the letters on the screen appear in a fast arrangement. His highest known typing speed was recorded to be 100 wpm.

Having had an interest in gaming since childhood, he has used different combinations with his fingers and placement to perform in video games. Playing game releases stress from David and offers a cure to boredom.
